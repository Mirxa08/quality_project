It is one of the guiding principles of the CRC Article 24 builds on and develops the right to life and survival and development to the maximum extent possible that is set out in article 6. Description All children, without discrimination on the basis of color, race, sex, language, religion, social background, disability or other, should have access to \"facilities for the treatment of illness and rehabilitation of health\" and to the \"highest attainable standard of health care The right to be heard Article 12 gives children the right to be heard on all matters that affect them and these views need to be given due weight Description This includes the child's right to give consent to treatment, to be involved in his or her treatment and to be able to give his or her opinion about the treatment. Respect for the views of the child needs to be built into healthcare and into the design of health services. Involving children in their healthcare will help them relieve any possible anxieties about their condition and associated treatment. Knowing that no action will be taken without their knowledge and consent will help them feel more confident and will encourage them to cooperate in treatment The right to privacy",
  "health services. Involving children in their healthcare will help them relieve any possible anxieties about their condition and associated treatment. Knowing that no action will be taken without their knowledge and consent will help them feel more confident and will encourage them to cooperate in treatment The right to privacy and respect for confidentiality Article 16 provides for the right of every child to privacy and respect for the confidentiality to be protected by law. The CRC provides that \"no child shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his or her privacy \u2026 or correspondence\". Description With respect to health care, this includes the right of the child to confidentiality in seeking medical advice, to access medical records and control who else can access those records. The right to confidential advice and counseling can extend to the right to withhold medical information from everyone except the medical professional involved, including parents. This has obvious applications for children experiencing violence or abuse at home, but also in seeking reproductive health education or services. Doctors sometimes have to comply with laws that impose parental consent but there is often scope for a professional judgment. Also, health professionals are in a good position to advocate for legal reform as they may have a lot of examples on why confidentiality is of particular importance for children. For example, children are likely to avoid seeking medical help if they fear that they will need their parents' or guardian's consent. The issue of confidentiality is separate to that of decisions over the child\u2019s care. Where a child lacks the capacity to make a determination about his or her care, it may frequently become necessary for medical professionals to discuss a child\u2019s care with parents or caregivers, but this does not override the child\u2019s right",
  "is separate to that of decisions over the child\u2019s care. Where a child lacks the capacity to make a determination about his or her care, it may frequently become necessary for medical professionals to discuss a child\u2019s care with parents or caregivers, but this does not override the child\u2019s right to confidential advice and counseling. Policy TIH/All/MD/CORE/POL/CPP/2021/V01 Wise Specified 01 15-04-2021 Access to information Article 17 includes a general obligation on governments that children have access to information and material from diverse sources, especially those aimed at promoting well-being and physical and mental health. Article 24(2)(e) requires that states take appropriate measures to ensure that children are informed about their health and various specific health issues. Description I. Children should receive appropriate information in order to be able to give their informed consent to treatment and medication. The prescription of drugs is often an important component of health care. But over the past ten years, lawsuits and investigations have cropped up around the world that raises concerns about not only testing drugs on children, but administering untested or unnecessary drugs on children. II. Children have the right to receive education on sexual and reproductive health. Sexual and reproductive health education is one of the most important ways to help children avert risks, improve their reproductive health and make informed decisions regarding their sexual and reproductive health. It is very important that health facilities provide information on sexual and reproductive health. III. This applies equally to LGBT children, and limiting access to information on these issues can have a profoundly negative effect on children\u2019s physical and mental health. With regards to sexual health, it is important that LGBT children understand the risks of sexual activity and the measures that can be taken to limit those risks. The dangers of sexually transmitted",
  "to information on these issues can have a profoundly negative effect on children\u2019s physical and mental health. With regards to sexual health, it is important that LGBT children understand the risks of sexual activity and the measures that can be taken to limit those risks. The dangers of sexually transmitted infections and the relative merits of various forms of contraception is important here, as is discussion over the emotional implications and dimensions of sexual relationships. Protection from all forms of violence and abuse Article 19 requires that the child is protected from \"all forms of physical and mental violence\" while in the care of parents or others. Health services must develop codes of practice and ensure that staff do not abuse or hurt children in any way. Health professionals also have an obligation to take action to protect children when they suspect that they have been abused or hurt by their parents or guardians. Article 19 is closely linked to the right to life and to survival and development guaranteed under article 6, and asserts children's rights to respect for their dignity and physical and personal integrity. Health staff\u2019s role in identifying, reporting, referring and treating cases of violence and abuse is crucial. Here again, the right to confidentiality and privacy is often a key to protect children from further harm and to build a relation based on trust with the child.

Pre-requisites for Induction of Labor (IOL): 3.2.1. Reconfirm gestational age: \uf0b7 There should be an ultrasound measurement of less than 20 weeks supporting a gestational age of 39 week or greater. \uf0b7 The patient has a regular cycle of 28 days and is sure of her last menstrual period (LMP), which is correlating with scan done at less than 20 weeks gestation. \uf0b7 If unsure of dates and/or irregular cycles, then consider 2 scans less than 24 weeks that correlate with each other. \uf0b7 If LMP is uncertain and scan less than 24 weeks is not available, then gestational age is best estimated by taking average of two scan done after 24 weeks, supplemented by symphysio-fundal height. 3.2.2. Review indication of IOL: For planned IOL, indication for IOL should be reviewed at admission. IOL is indicated when the fetal or maternal risks of early delivery outweigh the risk of prolonged pregnancy. 3.2.3. Consent for IOL: Informed consent should be taken before IOL. Counseling of patient, husband/attendant regarding indication, risks and benefits of induction of labor should be done before initiating IOL. TIH/ALL/MD/OBGYN/GDL/IOL/2020/V02 3.2.4.

It helps in making decision regarding the method of induction and assist in predicting the success of IOL. Refer to table below; Modified Bishop Score: 3.2.5. Bishop score < 6 is unfavorable cervix and associated with high failure rates. 3.2.6. If Bishop score is < 6 then cervical ripening is required before IOL. 3.3. Indications for IOL: 3.3.1. Post date: In low risk pregnancy IOL should be done at 41 week + 3 days. 3.3.2. Social: Social induction is labeled as such when there is no medical or obstetrical indication for delivery otherwise but IOL is done due to maternal request, logistic reasons like rapid labor, distance from care, psychosocial reasons, upcoming public holidays, strikes, etc. 3.3.3.

The decision for IOL is made by the consultant/ specialist in antenatal clinic or by the consultant/ specialist on call. 3.6.2. Social induction should be offered only if Bishop Score is 6 or more. All social inductions should be decided with input of consultant. 3.6.3. Four inductions should be booked for working days and two for weekend and public holiday. 3.6.4. Labor and Delivery (L&D) nurse should be informed beforehand if IOLs have exceeded the proposed number in order to arrange additional staff. 3.6.5. Senior Medical Officer (SMO)/specialist on call can hold some of the IOLs temporarily, keeping in view the safety of the mother and the fetus, if the L&D has high census. 3.6.6.

The resident/SMO should reconfirm the gestational age and establish the indication for induction. If there is any ambiguity, the case should be discussed with specialist/consultant on call. 3.6.8. On admission, complete assessment of the patient should be done by Resident/SMO including an abdominal and vaginal examination and a cardiotocography (CTG). 3.6.9. IOL should be initiated soon after assessment on admission while blood is sent for group and save, as required. 3.6.10. If there is a fetal indication for IOL such as Rhesus incompatibility or IUGR, Resident/SMO should communicate this to the pediatric team on admission. The pediatric resident should review the case and discuss with consultant pediatrician to plan management of the baby at delivery. 3.6.11. If there is no change in Bishop Score after Foley and Prostaglandin (PGE2), re- induction after 24 hours can be planned at consultant\u2019s discretion. 3.6.12. In cases of PROM, IOL with Foley catheter should not be done. 3.6.13. Distinction between ripening and induction is arbitrary and is a grey area with no clear demarcation. 3.7. Methods for Induction : 3.7.1. Prostaglandin E2: \uf0b7 Dinoprostone (Prostin, PGE2) 3mg is inserted in the posterior vaginal fornix. The woman is instructed to stay in bed, if possible, in the lateral position, for at least one hour after the insertion of the pessary. \uf0b7 CTG is taken for 30 minutes, one hour following PGE2 insertion. Thereafter, FHS is monitored hourly till regular contractions are established. TIH/ALL/MD/OBGYN/GDL/IOL/2020/V02 \uf0b7 3mg PGE2 can be repeated after 6 hours, if required. \uf0b7 Not more than two doses of PGE2 can be used in 24 hours. \uf0b7 Use of PGE2 in grand multipara will be done at consultant\u2019s discretion only. \uf0b7 Prostaglandins",

Intracervical Foley balloon \uf0b7 Mechanical method(balloon) should not be routinely used for induction of labour because of increased risk of intrauterine infections and dislodgment of fetal head. \uf0b7 It may be used in selected cases where PGE2 is contraindicated. \uf0b7 Under aseptic conditions, Foley catheter of size 22-24 is inserted into the cervical canal by either specialist/SMO or RMO/resident under supervision. Balloon is inflated with 60ml of distilled water. \uf0b7 After insertion of Foley catheter, CTG is performed for 20 minutes. Patient should be monitored in the labor ward. \uf0b7 Fetal Heart Sound (FHS) should be monitored 2 hourly by sonicaid for one complete minute and documented. \uf0b7 If Foley catheter is not extruded in 12 hours it should be deflated and removed. 3.7.3. Membrane sweeping \uf0b7 Stripping of membranes by sweeping releases local prostaglandin which helps in ripening cervix and initiation of labor. It can be initiated at clinic visits and at admission assessment. TIH/ALL/MD/OBGYN/GDL/IOL/2020/V02 \uf0b7 At 40 and 41 weeks, nulliparous women should be offered vaginal examination for membrane sweeping. And multiparous women should be offered at 41 weeks (in low risk pregnancies) 3.7.4. Oxytocin on \uf0b7 Oxytocin (syntocinon) infusion is used for IOL after discussion with the consultant obstetrician/ specialist. \uf0b7 Oxytocin therapy should be used with extreme caution, that is, with continuous vigilance and monitoring of uterine contractions, in grand multipara (parity\u22655).

Treatment for Hyper stimulation: 3.8.1 During IOL, medications for tocolysis should be available for immediate management of hyper stimulation. 3.8.2 Terbutaline 0.25mg subcutaneous(S/C) is given to reduce contractions and thus reduce fetal heart rate abnormality associated with hyper stimulation. 3.8.3 In patients with cardiac disease, terbutaline should be avoided. Deponite patch can be used for tocolysis in such patients. 3.9. Special case recommendations: 3.9.1. Women with scarred uterus will not be induced. TIH/ALL/MD/OBGYN/GDL/IOL/2020/V02 3.9.2. In women with IUFD, induction should be started after coagulation profile is checked. 3.9.3. Women presenting with ruptured membranes should be induced at least4-6 hours after rupture of membranes and if time is not known then can be induced soon after admission. 3.9.4. Patients with Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) controlled on Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT) should be induced at 40 completed weeks of gestation. 3.9.5. Patient with PIH/GDM controlled on medication should be induced at 39 completed weeks of gestation. 3.9.6. Uncomplicated twin pregnancy can be induced at term on the discretion of consultant. 3.9.7.

Initial assessment, provisional diagnosis and plan of management should be Title of Guideline: Labor and Delivery Management Guidelines Guideline Code: IHHN/ALL/MD/OBGY/GDL/LDM/2022/V03 Gynecology 03 documented (refer annexure A). 3.2.7. The women and their families should be counseled about the diagnosis and the management plan. 3.2.8. Women in latent phase of labor will be kept in antenatal room in labor ward. 3.3. Criteria for shifting admitted women to ward: 3.3.1. Threatened preterm labor. 3.3.2. Preterm pre-labor rupture of membranes planned for conservative management. 3.3.3. Women admitted for Blood pressure (BP) monitoring with no indication for urgent delivery. 3.3.4. Any woman with placenta previa planned for conservative management and settled bleeding. 3.3.5. A woman with reduced fetal movements and normal CTG. 3.4. Diagnosis of Labor: The diagnosis of true labor can be made on the basis of the following features: 3.4.1. Regular painful uterine contractions leading to cervical change. It may require at least two assessments 4 hours apart to reach the diagnosis of labor. 3.4.2. Unless there has been bleeding in excess of bloody show or clinical suspicion of placenta previa, vaginal examination will be performed. 3.4.3. If there is suspicion of membrane rupture, AVOID DIGITAL EXAMINATION. Clean vulva and vaginal introitus, insert a sterile speculum carefully and check for fluid in posterior vaginal fornix. If in doubt check the pH of that fluid. PH of Title of Guideline: Labor and Delivery Management Guidelines Guideline Code: IHHN/ALL/MD/OBGY/GDL/LDM/2022/V03 Gynecology 03 amniotic fluid is usually 7.0-7.5.

It should be offered to women at the start of active phase of labor. It is the responsibility of the anesthesia team to explain risks and benefits and take the consent for epidural analgesia. 3.9. Progress of Labor: Should be monitored on partograph which will be plotted as follows: 3.9.1. Start plotting on the partograph when: \uf0b7 The women are 3-4 centimeter (cm) dilated \uf0b7 If good contraction of 30-40 sec/3 in 10 minutes have started \uf0b7 If augmentation with oxytocin has been initiated. 3.9.2. Client information: Fill out name, gravida, para, medical record number, date and time of admission. 3.9.3. Time: Record actual time, use a 24- hour clock. 3.9.4. Onset of labor: Note the approximate time of onset of labor and rupture of membranes Title of Guideline: Labor and Delivery Management Guidelines Guideline Code: IHHN/ALL/MD/OBGY/GDL/LDM/2022/V03 Gynecology 03 if applicable. 3.9.5. Fetal Health Sound monitoring: Record half hourly in the first stage and after every contraction in the second stage. If any reading below 100 or above 160 (see bold lines), change position, hydrate where applicable, apply CTG and inform senior. 3.9.6. Contraction: Palpate contractions at fundus of the uterus. Mention frequency in 10 minutes, intensity and duration, every \u00bd hour in the first stage of labor. Mark on the program. 3.9.7.

Maternal Parameters on Partograph: Pulse, blood pressure, temperature, Input / output and any medication for example analgesia, oxytocin, antihypertensive, smooth muscle relaxant etc. given should be recorded. 3.11. Diagnosis of Dystocia Using a Partogram: 3.11.1. Dystocia should not be diagnosed in a primiparous woman if the cervix has not reached three to four cm and near 100 percent effacement. In a multiparous patient, the cervix should have reached four to five cm and be 70 to 80 percent effaced prior to a diagnosis of dystocia being considered. 3.11.2. Use mnemonic CCD: \uf0b7 C- If Contractions are inadequate that is duration < 45 sec, frequency < 3 in 10 minutes, intensity is mild. \uf0b7 C- If the Cervix is dilating at the rate of < 1 cm per hour. \uf0b7 D- If",

No absolute time limit should be set for the second stage if good progress is maintained and in the absence of fetal compromise. If within one hour of good contractions there is no descent of head, assess for intervention. 3.11.3. Identify the cause of problem using PPP: \uf0b7 P -Power - Is it inadequate? Give oxytocin. Title of Guideline: Labor and Delivery Management Guidelines Guideline Code: IHHN/ALL/MD/OBGY/GDL/LDM/2022/V03 Gynecology 03 \uf0b7 P -Passenger - Is it big or malposition? \uf0b7 P- Pelvis - Is it too small? At the inlet, mid or outlet? 3.11.4. Relate CCD to PPP to find out the cause. If contractions are good then suspect passage or passenger problem. 3.11.5. Record Keeping: The partograph should be kept with the maternal labor records. The partograph must be used for every patient in labor, unless she is fully dilated on admission. 3.12. First Stage of Labor: 3.12.1. Attention should be paid to personal hygiene of birthing woman and accoucher. 3.12.2. Advocate positive effects of \u201c3 clean\u201d (hands, perineal area, umbilical area) 3.12.3. Prevent infections including HIV/Hepatitis B /Hepatitis C by observing standard precautions and infection control protocols. 3.12.4. Maternal Monitoring \uf0b7 Check vital signs per shift in low risk pregnancy. In high risk labor check two hourly or as per doctor\u2019s recommendations. \uf0b7 Monitor and document contractions one hourly in latent phase and half hourly in active phase of labor.

In high risk labor check two hourly or as per doctor\u2019s recommendations. \uf0b7 Monitor and document contractions one hourly in latent phase and half hourly in active phase of labor. Observe for 10 minutes to see frequency, duration and intensity. \uf0b7 Optimum contractions are 3 in 10 minutes, lasting 40-60 seconds, moderate to severe intensity. \uf0b7 Inadequate contractions are 2 or less in 10 minutes/lasting less than 40 Title of Guideline: Labor and Delivery Management Guidelines Guideline Code: IHHN/ALL/MD/OBGY/GDL/LDM/2022/V03 Gynecology 03 seconds/mild intensity. \uf0b7 Tach systole is more than 5 contractions in 10 minutes with fetal heart rate abnormality. \uf0b7 Hyper stimulation is sustained contractions lasting for more than 60 seconds. 3.12.5. Fetal Monitoring: \uf0b7 For low risk, admission CTG for 20 minutes then intermittent auscultation by fetoscope/sonic aid, for complete one minute is recommended. Repeat CTG if any FHS abnormality is detected on auscultation or any intrapartum risk develops. \uf0b7 For high risk cases, for example, preterm, Intrauterine Growth retardation (IUGR), Diabetes Mellitus (DM), hypertension and augmented labour, continuous fetal heart rate monitoring on CTG machine with intermittent tracing e.g. for 15 - 20 minutes trace every 2 hour, or indicated otherwise, is recommended. 3.12.6. Augmentation of Labor: \uf0b7 Oxytocin is administered by slow infusion using an infusion pump, if available, to augment labor usually in conjunction with amniotomy. \uf0b7 Prepare oxytocin infusion as follows: \uf02d Standard dilution of 10 units in 500ml Ringer solution. \uf02d Start at 2 miliunit/min i.e. 6ml / hour (6 drops/min) and titrate against contractions at intervals of 30 minutes till a maximum of 32 Title of Guideline: Labor and Delivery Management Guidelines Guideline Code: IHHN/ALL/MD/OBGY/GDL/LDM/2022/V03 Gynecology 03 miliunit/min or when optimum contractions (3-4 contractions in 10 minutes of 40-45 seconds duration) are achieved.

The liner should be changed after preparation is completed for the day or after a shift, whichever comes first. Liners should also be changed after a spill; 4.3.3 A closed system is to be used by the preparing pharmacist/technician and administering nurse to ensure complete personnel protections including protectors, injectors, connectors and infusion adaptors; 4.3.4 A covered disposable container should be used to contain excess solution. A covered sharps container should be in the Biological Safety Cabinet. Cytotoxic labeled plastic bags to be available for all contaminated materials (including gloves, gowns), so that contaminated material can be immediately placed in them and disposed of in accordance with ASHP recommendations; 4.3.5 Aseptic technique is assumed as a standard practice in drug preparation. Manipulations should not be performed close to the work surface of a Biological Safety Cabinet. Unsterilized items, including liners and hands, should be kept downstream from the working area. 4.3.6 Entry and exit of the cabinet should be perpendicular to the front, Rapid lateral hand movements should be avoided; 4.3.7 All PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) should be prepared before work is started in the Biological Safety Cabinet, All items necessary for drug preparation should be placed within the Biological Safety",

In addition to standard pharmacy labeling practices, all syringes and IV bags containing cytotoxic should be labeled with a distinctive warning label, such as: CYTOTOXIC (HANDLE WITH CARE /DISPOSE PROPERLY); 4.3.9 All syringes and needles used in preparation should be placed in \"sharps\" containers for disposal without being crushed, clipped or capped; 4.3.10 Medication administration sets must be attached and primed within the Biological Safety Cabinet, prior to addition of the drug. This eliminates the need to prime the set in a less well-controlled environment and ensures that any fluid that escapes during priming contains no drug. If priming must occur at the site of administration, the intravenous line should be primed with non- drug containing fluid or a back-flow closed system should be used; 4.3.11 Extremes of positive and negative pressure in medication vials should be avoided, e.g., attempting to withdraw 10 cc of fluid from a 10-cc vial or placing 10 cc of a fluid into an air-filled 10-cc vial. The use of large-bore needles, #18 or #20, avoids high-pressure syringing of solutions. Multiuse dispensing pins are recommended to avoid these problems; 4.3.12 Venting devices such as filter needles or dispensing pins permit outside air to replace the withdrawn liquid. Although venting devices are recommended, another technique is to add diluent slowly to the vial by alternately injecting small amounts and allowing displaced air to escape into the syringe. When all diluent has been added, a small",

Although venting devices are recommended, another technique is to add diluent slowly to the vial by alternately injecting small amounts and allowing displaced air to escape into the syringe. When all diluent has been added, a small amount of additional air may be withdrawn to create a slight negative pressure in the OPR/PHR/MNL 02 - ________________________________________________________________________________________ vial. This should not be expelled into room air because it may contain drug residue. It should either be injected into a vacuum vial or remain in the syringe to be discarded; 4.3.13 If any negative pressure must be applied to withdraw a dosage from a stoppered vial and handling safety is compromised, an air- filled syringe should be used to equalize pressure in the stoppered vial. The volume of drug to be withdrawn can be replaced by injecting small amounts of air into the vial and withdrawing equal amounts of liquid until the required volume is withdrawn. The drug should be cleared from the needle and hub (neck) of the syringe before separating to reduce spraying on separation; 4.3.14 Ampules with dry material should be \"gently tapped down\" before opening to move any material in the top of the ampule to the bottom quantity. A sterile gauze pad should be wrapped around the ampule neck before breaking the top. This can protect against cuts and catch airborne powder or aerosol. If diluent is to be added, it should be injected slowly down the inside wall of the ampule. The ampule should be tilted gently to ensure that all the powder is wet before agitating it to dissolve the contents; 4.3.15 After the solution is withdrawn from the ampule with a syringe, the needle should be cleared of solution by holding",

The ampule should be tilted gently to ensure that all the powder is wet before agitating it to dissolve the contents; 4.3.15 After the solution is withdrawn from the ampule with a syringe, the needle should be cleared of solution by holding it vertically with the point upwards; the syringe should be tapped to remove air bubbles. Any bubbles should be expelled into a closed container; 4.3.16 The outside of bags or bottles containing the prepared drug should be wiped with moist gauze. Entry ports should be wiped with moist alcohol pads and capped. Transport should occur in sealed plastic bags and in containers designed to avoid breakage; 4.3.17 The handling of non-liquid forms requires special precautions as well. Tablets which may produce dust or potential exposure to the handler should be counted in a Biological OPR/PHR/MNL 02 - ________________________________________________________________________________________ Safety Cabinet. Capsules, i.e., gel-caps or coated tablets, are unlikely to produce dust unless broken in handling. These are counted in a Biological Safety Cabinet on equipment designated for hazardous drugs only; 4.3.18 Compounding should also occur in a Biological Safety Cabinet. A gown and gloves should be worn; 4.3.19 The pharmacists handling cytotoxic medications are well trained on I.V admixture and Chemotherapy preparations. 4.4 STORAGE AND TRANSPORT: 4.4.1. Storage Areas: Access to areas where cytotoxic medications are stored should be limited to authorized personnel with signs restricting entry; 4.4.2.

Gloves must be inspected for visible defects. 1.3. The outer gloves should cover the gown cuff whenever there is risk of exposure to hazardous drugs. 1.4. Gloves wear time: gloves should be changed every 30 minutes or when torn, punctured or contaminated. This recommendation is based on permeation studies using cytotoxic agents. 1.5. Double gloving is recommended for all activities involving hazardous drugs, including transport and handling of waste from patients recently treated with hazardous drugs. The like hood of permeation through two layers of gloves is small; however, wearing two pairs of gloves helps to protect the healthcare provider hands from contaminated that can occur when OPR/PHR/MNL 02 - IHHN/ALL/OPS/PHR/02/2020/01 removing gloves. 1.6. One pair is worn under the gown cuff & the second pair is placed over the cuff. 1.7. Outer gloves should be removed first, then",
